			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>
				Just as Kevin Durand wrote in his book “Pop Culture Meets the Academy”, both the videos essays in this project use popular culture as points of departure for arguments of another issue – gender roles and perspective on masculinity – without employing a “critical engagement” with the text. Nonetheless, these video essays are effective in exposing social issues that are easily overlooked. Their form of presentation is engaging to a broad audience, not just the people who have time to read long research papers; their arguments are made through rhetorical strategies such as irony, parallelism, and repetition; and they influence the audience through emotional appeals, logical appeals, or sometimes personal voice. Popular culture analysis in the genre of videos are just as valuable as the “critical engagement” of classic literature in that they uncover interesting and worthy social phenomenon and expose them to further debates and examinations.
