			<h1>Writer's Memo</h1>
			<p>
				This complex claim project originates from the forward of Kevin Durand's book <span style="font-style: italic;">Pop Culture Meets the Academy</span>. In his book Durand argues for critical engagement of pop culture pieces themselves instead of using them as points of departure to support other arguments. He compares pop culture pieces to classic literature in that there are intrinsic values such as those in classic literature.

				This piece is my trial to employ multiple visual forms on a webpage that mirrors the presentation of <a href="http://scalar.usc.edu/works/">Scalar Projects</a> â€“ that is, to present data in interactive and graphical formats. I considered two points in choosing this genre. First, I started out with the goal of exploring non-traditional texts with the intent of taking an academic analysis outside of its scholarly formats and conventions. Second, I wanted to provide more visual evidence in the form of images and videos than words, with the goal of making this project more engaging and easy to digest.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the final product of this project is not what I had in mind when I began. This prompts me to reevaluate my procedure and reflect on the outcomes and goal of this project. Besides the various skills that I need more practice with in the field of web-development, the most important lessons that I learn from this project are to make a detailed time management plan before actions and to separate design and content. The first of the two, applied in context of this project, are to plan out the end design features and bubble maps (contents) of the web pages. The latter reflection came when I found it to be extra slow and laborious when mixing the action of layout design (forms of presentation) and content generation (contents). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Those two reflections are themselves interlinked. Without a plan, or a roadmap, while taking on the design and writing in the same time would lead to failure. In future projects I should instead take more time and thoughts in the planning step rather than diving head-straight into the action. This ensures my mind to be clear during the production process.

				Life teaches in unexpected ways, and this is one of the many.
